    "# Text Classification Using a Convolutional Neural Network on MXNet\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is based of Yoon Kim's [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882) on using convolutional neural networks for sentence sentiment classification. The tutorial has been tested on MXNet 1.0 running under Python 2.7 and Python 3.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will train a convolutional deep network model on movie review sentences from Rotten Tomatoes labeled with their sentiment. The result will be a model that can classify a sentence based on its sentiment (with 1 being a purely positive sentiment, 0 being a purely negative sentiment and 0.5 being neutral).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step will be to fetch the labeled training data of positive and negative sentiment sentences and process it into sets of vectors that are then randomly split into train and test sets."
